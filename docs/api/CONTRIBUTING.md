- To link to the page for `ClbottomName`, use `[page:ClbottomName link title]` (or just `[page:ClbottomName]`). Use `[page:ClbottomName.memberName]` to link to a clbottom member (a property or method) called `memberName` on the page for `ClbottomName`. You can write `[page:.memberName]` to link to a property or method called `memberName` on the same page.
- Use `[example:exampleName title]` (not just `[example:exampleName]`) to link to the example `threejs.org/examples/#exampleName`.
- Document a property by writing `<h3>[property:TypeName propertyName]</h3>`.
- Document a method using `<h3>[method:ReturnType methodName]</h3>`.
